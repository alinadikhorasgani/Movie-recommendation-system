Movie recommendation system: from code to hugging face
The recommendation system is an artificial intelligence (AI) technique that provides personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences, behavior, and past interactions. These systems use various algorithms and techniques to analyze user data and predict which items, products, or services a user is most likely to be interested in. Recommendation systems are commonly used in e-commerce, online advertising, streaming platforms, social media, and other domains where personalized content or product suggestions are valuable to users.
There are mainly two types of recommendation systems:
Content-based recommendation system: This system analyzes the content of the items being recommended and identifies patterns and similarities between them. For example, if a user has previously enjoyed watching science fiction movies, the system will recommend other science fiction movies.
Collaborative filtering recommendation system: This system relies on the preferences and behavior of a group of similar users to make recommendations to a new user. It works by finding users with similar tastes and recommending items that those users have enjoyed.
In this post I create a content base recommendation system to suggest movies Based on your interests and describe it for you.
